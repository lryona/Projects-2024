## May 2024: Philippine Automated Teller Machine

Originally, this was made in C++ program during our second term as a freshman. I decided to implement this in Python instead.

This is not exactly polished as it solely inputs the balance of the user in terms of their withdraw/deposits, as well as check their balance.

As seen from the two files, my platform to complete this very mini project was Jupyter, but for a much efficient access of using my code in Github, I converted it to Python.

The reason why I use Jupyter was normally, I utilized this platform for data visualization and analysis. There are no other platforms I use at that time other than this.
