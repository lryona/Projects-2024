## May 2024: Philippine Automated Teller Machine

Originally, this was made in C++ program during our second term as a freshman. I decided to implement this in Python instead.

This is not fully polished as a standard full-functioning Philippine ATM since it solely inputs the allowance of the user in terms of checking its balance and being able to withdraw/deposit. Security features and viewing transaction history is not included.

As seen from the two files, my platform to complete this very mini project was Jupyter, but for a much efficient access of using my code in Github, I converted it to Python.

The reason why I use Jupyter was normally, I utilized this platform when practicing data visualization and analysis. There are no other platforms I use at that time other than this.

### for a much in-depth comprehension for my code:

I started defining its term functions used to withdraw, deposit, and check the user's balance. I do not need to class these defining variables since it will be unnecessary knowing my procedure will not be that huge.

So, I focused on introducing to one of the basic functions that I learned during my first year. To explain why my code is the way it is, it's simply because it's at least the most organized and efficient code to execute. Looping for the menu list ATM machine other than individually implement each line of code to how I can execute each option, conditional statements on each choice parameter after defining the term variables instead of hardcoding every scenario or recursions, and then I ensured that the script will directly run from the main file itself (although this project do not have multiple files, I still included the syntax for future additions). My sole focus on every project I implemented should have an efficient and practical model that is easily to understand and read.

I would also like to note that the syntax for implementing global states are removed in my py script but it is still seen through ipynb.
